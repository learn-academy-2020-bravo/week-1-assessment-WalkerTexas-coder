# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.   

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: a function is a dynamic variable. It is set up to take in information and process it according to design

  Researched answer: In programming, a named section of a program that performs a specific task. In this sense, a function is a type of procedure, routine or machine. Some programming languages make a distinction between a function, which returns a value, and a procedure, which performs some operation but does not return a value. (google- augmented by me)



2. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: Map can run through an array and return with a new array giving us useful information where as a filter can create a new array with desired data

  Researched answer:



3. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer: return operates as a part of a function where console.log calls the function desired to begin operation

  Researched answer: They do different things: .filter() returns a subset of the elements from the original array, while .map() produces an array with new, different entries based on the elements in the original array. (codeacademy forums)



4. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer: the information passed into the machine that is the function

  Researched answer: Arguments are values passed to the function when it is invoked. (codeburst.io)



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Driver and Navigator : immediate and medium- long scope separation. coding and researching. discussing/ thought process out loud

  Researched answer:  So when you encounter an extreme programmer, you can safely assume that she likes to pair and likes to practice test-driven development (TDD).

  The cadence works simply enough.  The first person writes a failing test and the second person gets it to pass.  Then the second person writes a failing test and the first person gets it to path.  Back and forth, back and forth.  Kind of like a game of ping pong.  

  This style works exceptionally well with two experts (particularly when that expertise includes TDD).  It also goes quite smoothly with the novice-expert pairing.  And interestingly enough, it might go best with novice-novice pairing, when the goal is getting the novices some practice.  All of these go so smoothly (notwithstanding any interpersonal issues) because the two switch roles so frequently as to think together constantly.(stackify)


6. What is TDD? Describe the work flow associated with TDD.

  Your answer: test driven development. writing the test before writing code allows the dev to take a step back and look at/ think about the approach to the problem at hand.

  Researched answer: Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the code is improved so that the tests pass. This is opposed to software development that allows code to be added that is not proven to meet requirements. (wikipedia)



7. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: PB&J, syntax reviews, google searching and Git hub deployment. I really like knowing I am learning things that are desired and not super well know amongst every coder out there.
